# Achievements

```javascript

- Controlling Web App using Voice

- 'Increased Performance': Independent Chart Loading (reduced template loading time to minutes to seconds)

- 'Polymer Memory Issues': Applied Singleton design pattern to reduce memory issue

- 'UI Template verisoning / Importers'

- 'Delayed Retries / DynamicRetryCount /  ' (/EnvVar ) - for handing low down stream

- 'CleanCode': handlePromise(...)

- 'Deliver Fast': customer feedbacks 
```

## Conflicts:

```javascript
- 'Independent Chart Loading': initialy this idea was accepted

- 'DeleteAll Button': UX was not happy, provided 'Confimation Dialog' & 'Undo' options
- '_.cloneDeep(...)' --> 'JSON.stringy(JSON.parse(...))'

```
