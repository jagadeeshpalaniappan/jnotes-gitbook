# Intro

* I’m currently working _full-time_ with GE - Digital as a **Staff Software Engineer**
  * I’m currently working as a Staff Software Engineer in GE - Digital
* I have more than `8 years` of experience in developing highly scalable web applications. 
* In this 8+ years of time, I have got a `wonderful opportunities`, 
  * to Learn and Work with End -to- End software web applications.
* * I’m a **FullStack Developer**, I have developed applications starting from scratch 

  * designing, developing \(Front-End & Back-End\) application and deploying them on cloud

* But I have more passion towards working Front-End development

  * in-fact, FrontEnd development is my hobby, 
  * I really enjoy working with Front-End web technologies

* In terms of `Front-End` experience, 

```javascript
- developing 'Single Page Web Application'

- developing 'Web Components' - using Polymer, React and Angular
    - developing 'higly re-usable Web Components'
    // technically webComponentShouldBe: 
    - highlyReUsable, 
    - Responsiveness (based on userViewport, screenSize: Mobile / Web) // how component should behave
    - Web Accessibility Support (WCAG) (ARIA attributes), 
        // for disabled person (who uses 'screenReader' VoiceOverApp )
        // color blindness ppl 
    - Internationalization Support (i18n)
    - API documentation (properties / methods)
    - dependency management / version management (SemVersioning) // v3.1.2 // 3:major, 1:minor, 2:patch


- developing 'Micro-Frontend' application // Like 'MicroServices' in backend
    - we can have 'Micro-Frontend' architecture in frontend
    - instead of building one 'big Monlethic Front-End' application,
    - we can split that into multiple small small frontEndApplications -base on modules/domain

    - This can helps us,
    - appsCan: horizontallyScale, independenltyUpgradeOrDowngrade -without affecting other apps
    - teamsCan: workIndependenlty, deployIndependenlty, ChooseTechnologyIndependenlty

```

* In terms of `Back-End` experience,

```javascript
- developing **'Node.js -Express'** based microservice back-end application
- developing new REST API's endpoints & also consuming other application REST API's

// - developing **'Java -Spring MVC / Spring Boot '** based back-end applications

I am primarily working with JavaScript, 
(I was also a Java Developer) // Its been more than 4+ years, i worked with Java

Nowadays, I am primarily focusing only on JavaScript
```

## Achievements

Apart from my daily office work, I also have done cool projects....

```javascript
1. Control WebApp UsingVoice    // Alexa, GoogleHome
    - just like 'Mouse' is one way to interact 
    - 'TouchScreen' is other way to interact

    - i proved that,
    - using 'Voice', we can interact web application

    - Steps:
    1. for understanding the 'native language' (NLP processing) 
        // i used Alexa // simmarly we can use 'Google Assistant', 'Siri',..
        // or build our own 'TensorFlow.js' 
        // I am not a more excited abt backend, i used the existing one 'Alexa'

    2. the core part is, I created API (for UI itself) (soundsStrange)
        // Just like 'DOM Tree', 'Accessibility Tree'
        // This API gives interaction to WebUI
        
        // Example: 'Click That Btn', 'Choose this Option from Dropdown', 'Focus on 2nd Chart', 'Scroll Down'
    
    3. Now, user voice --> will call --> frontEnd API --> frontEnd responds to it 
        // Open 'Analysis Template' (voiceInput) --> Alexa (NLP) --> Backend API --websocket--> FronEnd API --> Opens up the UI

// Goal of this POC is, Users can natively speak: to the Web
- This is not only helpful for 'disabled-person' // This helps normal user as well
- I have a strong beleif that, This will bring up 'new-standard' in Web // Just like Web Accessibility  
 
```

```javascript
2. Hyperion Monitor System
    - In Cisco, we had many hyperion windows servers
    - There are no proper monitoring apps available for it
    - Infact, one dedicated person used login each servers and monitor manually
    
    - I automated this process, 
        - provided the 'Dashboard' to View All the Servers one place
        - sends email if it cross threshold value
    - This logins all servers update the server status information
```

```javascript
3. Hack-a-thon Winner
- Tech Mahindra was conducting 'Hackathon Event' in Mission Innovation 2015
- OnTheSpotTopic: 'HealthCare' // within '24hrs' build an working Application

- App Name: 'SaveMe'
- when we are really in emergency, 
    - it is very hard to call 911 and communicate 'locationDetails' over voice
    - This app has 'one single button'
    - hold that btn, it will automatically communicate 
        - 'GPS location' with 911, Friends & Family, Personal Doctor
        - Pull 'Medical History' // so that we can do some treatement in Ambulance itself



// ScopeOfTheApp: can be expanded to 'Women Safety', 'Child Safety', ...


// Technoligies: iAmFronEndDeveloper 
// used Ionic, Cordova/PhoneGap (Hyrbid Mobile App)
```

There are still couple of todo items,

```javascript
TODO: (WebApp Ideas)

- 'Agile Home Work' // Kanban Board -for Home Work

- Group 'TODO' Actions: for friends and family

// buy:Grocerries, buy:ChristmasGifts, help:myKidAssignment, fix:bathRoomPipe, learn:ReactNative,  
// ...... build: myWebsite
```



In my free-time, I also **volunteer** and take 'free classes' to college students \(to give back my knowledge to society\)

All these activities motivates me to learn and keep up-to-date with latest technologies.
