# Negotiation

## My Feedback:

```javascript
- I liked <Manager Name> / Role ( looks like Very Challenging Work) / Work Place
- everything looks great

- definitely, this is the company i am looking for, 
    - I am very interested to join


- I am ready to 'relocate' for this role as well
```

## Numbers:

```javascript
Ask, 'Pay Structure'
- 'Base Salary' + Bonus + RSU (stock options)
-    <unknown>  +  10%  +  <unknown>
```



## Negotiation Talk

```javascript
- I would love to 'sign the offer right away',

- But I also have to consider my 'family needs', 'location', 'cost of living'

- I have to kind of balance my 'family needs' & 'career needs' 
```

**repeat**: the value you're bringing to the company

```javascript
Think: abt the value, I am bringing to the <ComapanyName>

- I am 'FullStackDev' & specialized on 'Front-End development' // Worked on Cloud 
- I can create a software end-to-end starting from scratch 
- (designing, developing-frontEnd, developing-backEnd, deploying all the way to cloud)
```



```javascript
- Anything you 'could do' to get closer to my target
- Would 'recongnize me' and give me 'piece of mind'

- So that, from day1
    - I cam 'fully focus'
    - put my 'full effort'
    - definetly i will make an impact at '<CompanyName>'
    

 I am really hopeful, we can get there.... 
```
