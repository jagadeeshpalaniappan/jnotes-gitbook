# 5. 'px' vs 'em' vs 'rem' \[ETODO\]

```fsharp

# em:
- 'em' is equal to the computed font-size of that element’s parent. 
- For example, If there is a div element defined with font-size: 16px then for that div and for its children 1em = 16px.

# rem: 
- 'rem' values are relative to the 'root html element' // not: parentEle
- For example, If font-size of the rootEle is 16px then 1 rem = 16px for all elements. 
- If font-size of the rootEle is not set, it take browser default value (usually 16px)


# px
- Pixels are the easiest measurement to use. But there is a catch. 
- Let’s say we used pixels throughout our website and we managed the media queries too. 
- What if a user changes the default font-size of browser (or device)? 
- Your header’s font-size (say 20px) will remain 20 px. Hence user’s font preferences won’t be reflected. Which is not a good user experience. 
- So, pixels may be good at spacing and layout but are not good fit for font-size. 

// ems and rems are at rescue


#TLDR;
-------
- Pixels are ignorant, don’t use them.
- Use REMs for sizes and spacing.
- Use EMs for media queries.
