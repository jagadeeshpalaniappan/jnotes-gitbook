# 2. CSS Specificity

#### Preferred Selectors :  `class-based` <a id="preferred-selectors"></a>

In order to understand why a class-based architecture makes a system easier to work with, we need to understand specificity.

## **Specificity**

Specificity is a value that is determined by the selector. The purpose of specificity is to be the tie breaker of which style gets applied to elements. If an element has two or more conflicting property declarations, the one with the highest specificity will win out. If an element has the same specificity, then the declaration that is defined last will win out.

* Elements or pseudo-elements add a value of 0,0,0,1
* Class attributes, attribute selection, or pseudo-classes add a value of 0,0,1,0
* ID attributes add a value of 0,1,0,0
* All inline styles have a value of 1,0,0,0

Examples CSS:

```css
p { color: red; } /* 0,0,0,1 */
.btn { color: orange; } /*  0,0,1,0 */
#btn { color: purple; } /*  0,1,0,0 */


p .btn { color: orange; } /*  0,0,1,1 */
.btn.btn.btn.btn.btn.btn.btn.btn.btn.btn.btn { color: red; } /*  0,0,11,0 */

```

Classes are the preferred selector because they are highly reusable with relatively low specificity. It is also very easy to be descriptive with class names as opposed to multiple elements chained together \(e.g. .nav-primary {} is much nicer than header ul {}\). It is not recommended to use IDs, as they are very high in specificity and they are not reusable.

Note: Chaining classes together can never over ride the specficty of an ID. This can be seen in the last two examples above. The specficy of 0,0,11,0 is still lower than 0,1,0,0.



## What is Specificity?

If two CSS selectors apply to the same element, the one with **`higher` specificity wins**.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Specificity is a common reason why your CSS-rules don't apply to some elements, although you think they should.
{% endhint %}

## How to Calculate Specificity?

Start at 0, 

* add **1000** for `style` attribute
* add **100** for each `id`
* add **10** for each `[attribute]`, `.class` or `:pseudo-class` 
* add **1** for each `<element-name>` or `pseudo-element`

```css
div#a {background-color: green;}      /* specificity: 1+100 = 101 (applied)   */
#a {background-color: yellow;}        /* specificity: 100   = 100             */
div[id=a] {background-color: blue;}   /* specificity: 1+10  =  11             */
div {background-color: blue;}         /* specificity: 1     =  1              */
```

_**Rules:**_

* **Equal specificity:** the `latest rule` ****will be styled
* **'id'** selectors**:** have a higher specificity than &gt; _'attribute'_ _selectors_ 
* **'class'** selectors beats &gt; element selectors 
* The universal selector and inherited values have a specificity of 0
  * \*, body \* and similar have a zero specificity.
* 


* **Equal specificity:**  embedded `<style>`  and external style `external.css` 
  * `latest rule` ****will be applied
  * here, external.css is latest rule

```markup
<head>
    <style>
        h1 { color: red;}
    </style>
    
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="external.css">
    <!-- h1 { color: green;} -->
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
</body>
```

## !important

* !important declarations overrides the cascading nature of CSS 
* It means, this rule is **`!important`** _\(apply this rule\)_
  * ignore specificity rules, subsequent rules _\(just apply this rule\)_

```css
div#a {background-color: green;}        /* specificity: 1+100 = 101             */ 
#a {background-color: yellow;}          /* specificity: 100   = 100             */
div[id=a] {background-color: blue;}     /* specificity: 1+10  =  11             */
div {background-color: pink !important;}/* specificity: 1     =  1   (applied)  */
```

What if same element has 2 or more conflicting CSS rules that has **!important** 

* **`!important`** + `Higher Specificity` wins

```css
div#a {background-color: green;}         /* specificity: 1+100 = 101             */ 
#a {background-color: yellow !important;}/* specificity: 100   = 100 (applied)   */
div[id=a] {
 background-color: blue; !important;     /* specificity: 1+10  =  11             */
} 
div {background-color: pink !important;} /* specificity: 1     =  1               */
```

* **`!important`** + `Higher Specificity` + `Order` wins

```css
div#a {background-color: green;}         /* specificity: 1+100 = 101             */ 
#a {background-color: yellow !important;}/* specificity: 100   = 100             */
div[id=a] {
 background-color: blue; !important;     /* specificity: 1+10  =  11             */
} 
div {background-color: pink !important;} /* specificity: 1     =  1              */
#a {background-color: red !important;}   /* specificity: 100   = 100 (applied)   */
```
