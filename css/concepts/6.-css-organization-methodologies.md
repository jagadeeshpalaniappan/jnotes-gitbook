# 1. CSS Organization Methodologies

## CSS Organization Methodologies 

```bash
## OOCSS 
    - CSS ‘object’ as "a repeating visual pattern"
    - Sepearte: 'Structure & Skin' , Sepearte: 'Container & Content'

## BEM
    - Naming Rules
    - Block1__Elem1--Modif1
    
## SMACSS
    - file structure (for large CSS projects)
    - order: Basic >> Layout >> Module >> State >> Theme

## ITCSS
    - OOCSS + Organized CSS properties based on their level of specificity 

## Functional CSS (or Atomic CSS) 
     - 'utility-class' everywhere

## CSS Modules
    - 
```

## **1. OOCSS — 'Object Oriented' - CSS**

* Object Oriented
  * procedural backend code vs Object-Oriented backend code
  * classic CSS vs OOCSS

> _CSS ‘object’ as `"a repeating visual pattern"`, that can be abstracted into an **independent snippet** of HTML and CSS code. That object can then be reused throughout a site._

> No matter where you put, "object should look the same"

* This methodology is based on two basic principles: 
  1. **Separation of `Structure` and `Skin`**
     * **structure:**  height, width, margin, padding, overflow,...
     * **skin:** fonts, color, background, shadows, gradients
  2. **Separation of `Container` and `Content`:** 
     * Container: A  block or wrapper element that has as one or many child elements inside
     * Content: Child component part of a Container

Similar to object-oriented programming, **OOCSS focuses on flexible and reusable components, each doing one thing well**. This alone encompasses basic programming principles such as [single responsibility principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle), [separation of concerns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) and [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).

It also checks one essential UX and Graphic Design box: **Consistency**. By re-using a similar button design throughout the interface, users get familiar with it, and the app feels more intuitive each new session. With OOCSS, we’re merely re-using code, making it faster and easier to create more things, without adding significant overhead to the codebase. DRY CSS, people!

[Nicole Sullivan wrote this post back in 2010](http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2010/06/25/the-media-object-saves-hundreds-of-lines-of-code/), explaining the power of OOCSS in the media object. The main takeaway from that article is the ability to isolate and abstract interface patterns into self-contained code blocks for both HTML and CSS. Here is an example of Nicole’s Media Object:

```markup
<div class="media">
  <a href="#" class="img">
    <img src="" alt="" />
  </a>
  <div class="bd"></div>
</div>
```

```css
.media {...}
.media .img {...}
.media .img img{...}
.media .imgExt{...}
.bd {...}
```

The idea here? Encapsulate the component so it won’t require styles from anywhere else in your CSS to work properly. Once you have that, you can start putting the Media component everywhere in your interface, and it should behave consistently in every instance.

Note: In contrast to the rest of the methodologies we will see after OOCSS, this one does not establish rules when naming classes, as well as it does not offer suggestions on whether to use IDs and tags or not, at the time of give style. Despite this lack of rules, the principles of this method invite us to deduce how to use these features. That is why, BEM is nowadays considered to be the perfect complement for OOCSS methodology.

## 2. BEM \(Block\_\_Element--Modifier\) <a id="9b46"></a>

* BEM may be defined as a concrete application of OOCSS. 
* It tries to address the **`naming issue`** 
  * by suggesting a structured way of naming classes, based on properties
* * **BEM uses only classes:** Blocks, Elements, Modifiers are defined by class selectors.
* **BEM does not use** HTML tags or IDs as selectors
  * it doesn't use class connected to a HTML tag, 

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Pseudo code" %}
```css
/* 
#### Block: #### 
- Block is the 'root' of particular component (or css object)
- It can work independent. It is self-contained starting context 
- It can have any number of 'Elements'. It can also carry 'Modifiers'.
*/
.block {}

/* 
#### Element: #### 
- Element is a child component (part of a Block)
- It cannot work independent. - It always works properly with appropriate parent 'Block'
- An element inherits styes. It can also carry Modifiers.
*/
.block__elem1 {}
.block__elem2 {}
.block__elem3 {}


/* 
#### Modifier: #### 
- Denoted by two hyphens.
- A variation of a Block or Element. 
- These extend styles.
*/

.block__elem1--modif1 {}
.block__elem1--modif2 {}
.block__elem1--modif3 {}

.block--modif1 {}
.block--modif2 {}
```



```markup
<div class="block">
    <div class="block__elem1">
        <div class="block__elem2"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="block__elem3"></div>
</div>

<div class="block--modif1">
    <div class="block__elem1">
        <div class="block__elem2"></div>
    </div>

    <div class="block__elem3"></div>
</div>
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Example" %}
```css
/* #### Block: #### */

.card {}
.list {}

/* #### Element: #### */

.card__header {}
.card__body {}
.card__footer {}

.list__item {}

/* #### Modifier: #### */

.card--darktheme {}
.card--disabled {}
.card--big {}

.card__header--special {}
.card__body--special {}
.card__footer--special {}

.list--darktheme {}
.list__item--active {}

```



```markup
<div class="card">
    <div class="card__body">
        <h2> I'm a light card</h2>
        <p> And .....</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="card card--darktheme">
    <div class="card__body">
        <h2> I'm a light card</h2>
        <p> And .....</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

{% tab title="SASS helps BEM" %}
**'SASS' helps to do BEM easier**

```css
.card {
    &__header { ... }
    &__body { ... }

    &--darktheme { ... }
}
```

SASS generates below CSS code

```css
.card__header { ... }
.card__body { ... }

.card--darktheme { ... }
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}



## **3. SMACSS \(Scalable and Modular Architecture\)**

SMACSS is more like a “style guide” than a rigid CSS framework. It focuses on five categories for its rules:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Rules" %}
1. **Base:** It is used for default styles \(like `html`, `body`, `a`, `a:hover`\). This includes your CSS resets and would often be in its own base CSS file or at the start of your main CSS. A good equivalent would be the common reset.css or normalize.css.
2. **Layout:** It divides the content into sections \(like header, footer, and article\), understanding that in each section the content would be divided into modules. It would be same as using containers or a grid. 
3. **Module:** is a reusable component 
4. **State:** The rules that establish the 'state' of our modules \(e.g. `active`, `inactive`, `expanded`, `hidden`\). An example would be the active state of a .list-item. States also include modules states according to where that module is inside the page. 
5. **Theme** is similar to state but defines how modules and layouts will look. This last category is an optional one. It would allow the more visual aspects of the project `light-theme`, `dark-theme`, `blue-theme`
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="...More" %}
**style.scss:** Core file: imports the others.

**\_base.scss:** Includes `normalize.css`, and also sets styles on base elements: `html`, `body`, `a`, `ul`, `li`, etc.

**\_layout.scss:** Depending on the complexity of the site, we will likely have a file dedicated to layout. Grids, responsive frameworks, wrappers, etc. all live here.

**\_modules.scss:** Includes definitions for our modules, or **objects**. The goal is for as much code to exist in here as possible, making it flexible and reusable. This file will just be a list of modules defined \(and documented\) one after another.

**\_other.scss:** The name for this partial varies, but essentially this is all the code that doesn't fit in `_base`, `_layout`, or `_modules`. Code we just couldn't make modular; glue between modules; top level layouts; etc.

----

**\_shame.scss**: a `_shame` file is something we've been trying out only recently. This file is a place where you put all the code you're not proud of, with the intention of A\) isolating it and B\) fixing it later. The goal is for this file to be empty, but some times you just have to throw that hack in there to get it working.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

#### SMACSS does define CSS naming rules:

* Prefix `l-` or layout- for layout rules. // .l-grid, .l-container
* Prefix `module-` for modules.
* Prefix `is-` for states.



## 4. ITCSS \(Inverted Triangle CSS\)

ITCSS — which stands for Inverted Triangle CSS — is a fully managed CSS Architecture. It’s not a framework or library; there’s nothing to download or install.It’s a collection of principles and metrics by which developers should group and order their CSS in order to keep it scalable, terse, logical, and manageable.

It is a modern ways of organizing CSS often fall back to **modularization** or **CSS objects** to construct abstract ideas.The new idea of [Inverted Triangle CSS](http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/manage-large-scale-web-projects-new-css-architecture-itcss-41514731) is a **layered way of `splitting CSS properties`** ``**`based on their level of specificity` and importance**. By default, ITCSS uses the same principles as [OOCSS](https://github.com/stubbornella/oocss/wiki) but **with greater separation** based on specificity. So if you’re already familiar with OOCSS, consider this a unique **alternate CSS architecture** to try.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="ITCSS" %}
ITCSS does this by inviting us to think in terms of specificity starting from far-reaching, app-wide styling to granular, single-element effected styling. Hence the “Inverted Triangle.”

What it ends up looking like:

![Image: medium.com](https://miro.medium.com/max/900/1*Xhi7zBs-ZEON9HfCfFQg3A.png)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Rules" %}
* **Settings**: global variables, site-wide settings, config switches \(no actual CSS output\) 
* **Tools**: site-wide mixins and functions \(no actual CSS output\) 
* **Generic**: Low-specificity, far-reaching rule sets 
  * CSS resets normalize.css, or your own batch of code
* **Base/Elements**: HTML element selectors without classes
* ------
* **Objects**: Classes for page structure typically following the OOCSS methodology
* **Components**: classes for styling any & all page elements 
  * \(often combined with the structure of object classes\) \(UI components Skins\)
* ------
* **Trumps**: he most specific styles for overriding anything else in the triangle
  * high-specificity, very explicit selectors. Overrides and helper classes

The settings, tools, generic, and _**`base layers should remain relatively untouched`**_ The majority of the CSS for a component should reside in the component layer.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Example" %}
```css
/* ITCSS Structure */
/* https://github.com/aarongarciah/itcss-sample/tree/master/src/scss */

// 01. Settings
@import '01-settings/settings.config';
@import '01-settings/settings.animations';
@import '01-settings/settings.breakpoints';
@import '01-settings/settings.colors';
@import '01-settings/settings.spacing';
@import '01-settings/settings.typography';
@import '01-settings/settings.z-layers';

// 02.Tools
@import '../../node_modules/sass-mq/mq.scss';
@import '02-tools/tools.animations';
@import '02-tools/tools.clearfix';
@import '02-tools/tools.hidden';
@import '02-tools/tools.on-event';
@import '02-tools/tools.placeholder';
@import '02-tools/tools.spacing';

// 03. Generic
@import '../../node_modules/normalize.css/normalize.css';
@import '03-generic/generic.selection';

// 04. Elements
@import '04-elements/elements.all';
@import '04-elements/elements.body';
@import '04-elements/elements.html';
@import '04-elements/elements.links';

// 05. Objects
@import '05-objects/objects.container';
@import '05-objects/objects.wrapper';
@import '05-objects/objects.modal';

// 06. Components
@import '06-components/components.alert';
@import '06-components/components.button';

// 99. Utilities
@import '99-utilities/utilities.clearfix';
@import '99-utilities/utilities.text';
@import '99-utilities/utilities.visibility';
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

**Problem:** One of the most common problems in CSS is not understanding why an element is getting a specific style. Even with a good understanding of how specificity works, without a well-organized CSS file, it can be nearly impossible to untangle subtree collisions.

* ITCSS is organized with the styles that have the most reach and lowest specificity at the top of a CSS file down to the most explicit and highest specificity declarations. 
* ITCSS works with the cascade and selector specificity; 
* it is performance and scale-oriented out of the box.

Here are some of the greatest benefits of using ITCSS:

* Page objects can be split into their own CSS/SCSS files for **reusability**. It’s simple to copy/paste and extend every object **into other projects**.
* Depth of specificity is **up to you**.
* There’s **no set folder structure**, and no required use of preprocessing tools.
* You can merge concepts from other methodologies such as [CSS modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) to **create your own hybrid workflow**.

## 5. Functional CSS \(Atomic CSS\)

Functional CSS \(sometimes referred to as atomic CSS\) is the practice of using small, immutable and explicitly named utility classes to construct components. A variety of stock, ready-to-go class libraries, such as [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io/docs/layout/grid/) and the increasingly popular [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/what-is-tailwind/), have sprung up to make starting with functional CSS as easy as possible.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="First Tab" %}
So, instead of creating a custom component, semantically or visually named, such as:

```text
<div class="card">A card</div>
```

You would construct the component’s styling rules within the markup through a combination of utility classes. For example:

```text
<div class="padding-sm border-radius-sm bgc-white"></div>
```

In the same way that functional programming encourages purity and predictability, functional CSS promotes the use of single-purpose and ‘pure’ classes that consistently behave the same regardless of context \(or ‘scope’ in traditional programming\).

To write genuinely re-usable CSS, we already enter into visual and functional abstractions, such as ‘card’ instead of ‘news-item’, or ‘media-object’ instead of ‘author-profile’. This is the premise for all UI libraries, from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) through to [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/). As [Adam Wathan](https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/), author of Tailwind CSS notes:

> ‘There’s no pretending that .stacked-form is any more ‘semantic’ than .align-right; they’re both named after how they affect the presentation of the markup, and we are using those classes in our markup to achieve a specific presentational result.’
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Second Tab" %}
**Combining Functional CSS** 

Despite the tension between both sides of the argument, there is a [growing convergence](https://css-tricks.com/why-cant-we-use-functional-css-and-regular-css-at-the-same-time/) towards adopting both a component and functional approach into what Tailwind has dubbed [‘utility-first’](https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/):

```text
.btn {
  @apply font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded;
}
```

```text
<!-- Should this be 'card--large' and 'card--light' ? -->
<div class="card bg-white padding-lg">Card</div>
```

```text
<div class="bg-white padding-md flex">
    <div class="profile">Jay Freestone etc.</div>
</div>
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% tab title="Why?" %}
#### Why should we use CSS Modules? <a id="article-header-id-1"></a>

With CSS Modules, it’s a guarantee that all the styles for a single component:

1. Live in one place
2. Only apply to that component and nothing else

Plus, any component can have a true dependency, like:

```text
import buttons from "./buttons.css";
import padding from "./padding.css";

element.innerHTML = `<div class="${buttons.red} ${padding.large}">`;
```

**This approach is designed to fix the problem of the** _**global scope**_ **in CSS.**

Have you ever been tempted by a lack of time or resources to simply write CSS as quickly as possible, without considering what else you might affect?

**---**

Which is the best one? There is no simple answer, each developer would choose the appropriate one according to what each project needs or his/her way of work. When it gets to the bottom of the matter, all of them follow the same ‘good practice’ policy.

The important thing is that every one of them looks for the essential in a big project: scalability and good maintenance, and the combination of both, therefore we should not take them as manual books, but instead as tools to improve our code and with it, our projects.



**We use:** ITCSS, BEM, OOCSS \(Sass-based\)
