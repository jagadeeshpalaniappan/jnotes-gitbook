# 4. DFS



![](http://how2examples.com/artificial-intelligence/images/Depth-First-Search.gif)

* Depth-first search starts at the root node and continues down a particular path \(branch\) 
  * - selecting a child node at the deepest level of the tree to expand next. 
* Only when the search hits a dead end \(a node that has no child nodes\) does the search "backtrack" - continuing the search from the last node it encountered whose child nodes have not been fully examined.
* Unlike breadth-first search, 
  * depth-first search is not guaranteed to find the solution with the shortest path. 
* As it is possible for depth-first search to proceed down an infinitely long branch, without ever returning to explore other branches, there is no guarantee that depth-first search will ever find a solution, even when one exists. 
* The memory requirements of depth-first search are more modest than breadth-first search. 
* Only a single path from the root node to the current node, plus any unexpanded nodes on the path, need to be stored.
