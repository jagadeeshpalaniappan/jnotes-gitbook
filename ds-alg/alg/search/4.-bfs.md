# 3. BFS

* As breadth-first search exhaustively examines every node at a particular depth 
  * before progressing to the next level, 
* it is guaranteed to find the solution, if one exists, with the shortest path from the initial state. 
* A disadvantage of breadth-first search is that it can have a high memory requirement - as a record needs to be maintained of every expanded node.
