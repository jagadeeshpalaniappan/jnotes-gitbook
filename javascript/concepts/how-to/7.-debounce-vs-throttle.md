# Debounce vs Throttle

**Debounce** and **throttle** are two similar \(but different!\) techniques \[VERY IMP for PERF\]

* to control 'how many times'
* we allow a **function** to be **executed** over time.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Throttle" %}
```fsharp
throttle: guarantees the execution of the function regularly, at least every X milliseconds.


# Analogy: Ordering drink at Bar
- Bar has a policy 'we can only order a drink - every 15 minutes only'
- 1st minute, you ordered one drink
- 2nd minute, you are trying to order one drink // barman denies the drink untill 15min
- 3rd minute, you are trying to order one drink // barman denies the drink untill 15min
- 4th minute, you are trying to order one drink // barman denies the drink untill 15min
- You tiered of ordering

- After 15 minute, waiter will get the lastOrder (4th min order) drink for you


```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Debounce" %}
```fsharp
debounce: 
lastCall --> wait for X milliseconds --> if no new request ==> call the expensiveFn

Hey, I’m not going to execute that function until I know there are no more changes inbound


# Analogy: Ordering food at Restaurant
- Waiter taking orders from the customer
- Customer is keep changing the order items
- Is that finalOrder? and a little pause, if noNewChanges that means it is finalOrder executeIt


```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Where to use what" %}
```fsharp
# Example use cases

- Wait until the user stops resizing the window    // debounce: window 'resize' event
- Dont fire an ajax event until the user stops typing    // debounce: input 'keypress' event

- Measure the scroll position of the page and respond at most every 50ms // throttle: 'scroll' event
- OnScroll: getMoreItems // throttle: 'scroll' event

- Ensure good performance as you drag elements around in an app

## Debounce & Throttle \(Lodash  Implementation\):

```javascript
_.throttle(function() {
    // every 1000ms it --> call 'expensiveFn'
    expensiveFn();
}, 1000)
```

```javascript
_.debounce(function() {
    // lastCall + wait 1000ms
    // (if no new request comes within this wait time) it --> calls 'expensiveFn'
    expensiveFn();
}, 1000)
```

\*\*\*\*

* **Throttle:** 
  * `every 1000ms --> call 'expensiveFn'`  
  * \(irrespective of user completed the action fully or not -- it calls every 1000ms \)
  * it doesn't wait for user actions to complete
* **Debounce:** 
  * `lastCall --> wait 1000ms -->`
  * `(if no new rqst comes within this wait time) it --> calls 'display_info'`
  * * \(after user completed the action fully\) \(call expensiveFn\)
    * How do you identify that? \(using 'wait time'\)
    * In this **wait time,** if [no new changes](../todo.md) user made,
      * ---&gt; we can assume that 'that is last change user made'
    * then immediately call the _actual fn_

## Debounce & Throttle \(Custom  Implementation\):

**Debounce:**

Debouncing enforces that a **"function not be called again"** until a certain **"amount of time** **has** **passed"** `without it is being called`. For example, “execute this function only if 100 milliseconds have passed without it being called.”

_In other words_: The debounce technique allows us to “group” multiple raised sequential functions into a single function.

```javascript
// as long as it continues to be invoked, it will not be triggered
function debounce (func, interval) {
  var timeout;
  return function () {
    var context = this, args = arguments;
    var later = function () {
      timeout = null;
      func.apply(context, args);
    };
    clearTimeout(timeout);
    timeout = setTimeout(later, interval || 200);
  }
}
```

**Short-form:**

```javascript
function debounce(func, waitTime) {
    var timeout;

    return function () {
        clearTimeout(timeout);
        timeout = setTimeout(func, waitTime);
    };
};
```

## **Throttle**

Throttling enforces a **"maximum number of times"** a function can be called over time.

For example, “**execute this function** at most once `every 100 milliseconds`”

_In other words_: By using throttle, we don’t allow to our function to execute more than once every X milliseconds.

```javascript
// as long as it continues to be invoked, raise on every interval
function throttle (func, interval) {
  var timeout;
  return function() {
    var context = this, args = arguments;
    var later = function () {
      timeout = false;
    };
    if (!timeout) {
      func.apply(context, args)
      timeout = true;
      setTimeout(later, interval)
    }
  }
}
```

More Reading...

**Debounce and throttle are two programming techniques when it comes to UI Performance.**

* It’s important to know when to use them — but also important to know when not to use them. 

Debounce and throttle are recommended to use on events that fire more often than you need them to.  
You may have come across scenarios like this

* when binding to 
* mouse movements 
* window events \(such as scrolling, push notifications and Ajax calls\)
