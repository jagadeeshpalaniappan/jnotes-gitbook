# Debounce vs Throttle

**Debounce** and **throttle** are two similar \(but different!\) techniques 

* to control 'how many times'
* we allow a **function** to be **executed** over time.

The main difference between **Throttling** and **Debouncing** is that 

* throttle **`guarantees`** the `execution` of the function regularly, 
  * at least every X milliseconds.
* debounce does NOT,
  * `LastCall --> wait for X milliseconds --> if no new request ==> call the fun`

### Debounce & Throttle \(Lodash  Implementation\):

```javascript
_.throttle(function() {
    // every 1000ms it --> call 'expensiveFn'
    expensiveFn();
}, 1000)
```

```javascript
_.debounce(function() {
    // lastCall + wait 1000ms
    // (if no new request comes within this wait time) it --> calls 'expensiveFn'
    expensiveFn();
}, 1000)
```

\*\*\*\*

* **Throttle:** 
  * `every 1000ms --> call 'expensiveFn'`  
  * \(irrespective of user completed the action fully or not -- it calls every 1000ms \)
  * it doesn't wait for user actions to complete
* **Debounce:** 
  * `lastCall --> wait 1000ms -->`
  * `(if no new rqst comes within this wait time) it --> calls 'display_info'`
  * * \(after user completed the action fully\) \(call expensiveFn\)
    * How do you identify that? \(using 'wait time'\)
    * In this **wait time,** if [no new changes](../todo.md) user made,
      *  ---&gt; we can assume that 'that is last change user made'
    * then immediately call the _actual fn_





### Debounce & Throttle \(Custom  Implementation\):

**Debounce:**

Debouncing enforces that a **"function not be called again"** until a certain **"amount of time** **has** **passed"** `without it is being called`. For example, “execute this function only if 100 milliseconds have passed without it being called.”

_In other words_: The debounce technique allows us to “group” multiple raised sequential functions into a single function.

```javascript
// as long as it continues to be invoked, it will not be triggered
function debounce (func, interval) {
  var timeout;
  return function () {
    var context = this, args = arguments;
    var later = function () {
      timeout = null;
      func.apply(context, args);
    };
    clearTimeout(timeout);
    timeout = setTimeout(later, interval || 200);
  }
}
```



**Short-form:**

```javascript
function debounce(func, waitTime) {
    var timeout;

    return function () {
        clearTimeout(timeout);
        timeout = setTimeout(func, waitTime);
    };
};
```



### **Throttle**

Throttling enforces a **"maximum number of times"** a function can be called over time. 

For example, “**execute this function** at most once `every 100 milliseconds`”

_In other words_: By using throttle, we don’t allow to our function to execute more than once every X milliseconds.

```javascript
// as long as it continues to be invoked, raise on every interval
function throttle (func, interval) {
  var timeout;
  return function() {
    var context = this, args = arguments;
    var later = function () {
      timeout = false;
    };
    if (!timeout) {
      func.apply(context, args)
      timeout = true;
      setTimeout(later, interval)
    }
  }
}
```







More Reading...

**Debounce and throttle are two programming techniques when it comes to UI Performance.** 

* It’s important to know when to use them — but also important to know when not to use them. 

Debounce and throttle are recommended to use on events that fire more often than you need them to.   
You may have come across scenarios like this 

* when binding to 
* mouse movements 
* window events \(such as scrolling, push notifications and Ajax calls\)
